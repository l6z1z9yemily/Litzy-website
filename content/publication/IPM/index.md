  Politicians’ tweets can have important political and economic implications.
  However, limited context makes it hard for readers to instantly and precisely
  understand them, especially from a causal perspective. The triggers for these
  tweets may have been reported in news prior to the tweets, but simply finding
  similar news articles would not serve the purpose, given the following
  reasons. First, readers may only be interested in finding the reasons and
  contexts (we call causal backgrounds) for a certain part of a tweet.
  Intuitively, such content would be politically relevant and accord with
  public’s recent attention, which is not usually reflected within the context.
  Besides, the content should be human-readable, while the noisy and informal
  nature of tweets hinders regular Open Information Extraction systems. Second,
  similarity does not capture causality and the causality between tweet contents
  and news contents is beyond the scopes of causality extraction tools.
  Meanwhile, it will be non-trivial to construct a high-quality tweet-to-intent
  dataset.


  We propose the first end-to-end framework for discovering causal backgrounds of politicians’ tweets by: 1. Designing an Open IE system considering rule-free representations for tweets; 2. Introducing sources like Wikipedia linkage and edit history to identify focal contents; 3. Finding implicit causalities between different contexts using explicit causalities learned elsewhere. We curate a comprehensive dataset of interpretations from political journalists for 533 tweets from 5 US politicians. On average, we obtain the correct answers within top-2 recommendations. We make our dataset and framework code publicly available.

summary: A tweet interpretation framework which automatically extracts focal
  tweet clauses and tracks previous news to discover the event-specific reasons
  that trigger politicians to tweet them.
